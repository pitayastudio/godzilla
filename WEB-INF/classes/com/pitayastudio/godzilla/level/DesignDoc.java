   * Control Level.
   *
   * <p>Influence is generated radically from color stones of {@link Gang}s, and is received by nearby
   * vacant posits.
   * Received Influence on a vacant posit is cumulative, and the sum is called CtrlLevel.
   * Influence is radiated from {@link Gang}s, but not from {@link Dragon}s.
   * Prisoners don't radiate.
   * Radiated influence could be reflected by walls.
   * The corner doesn't reflect anyhow.
   * If the stone touches the wall, it doesn't reflect.
   * Influence could pass through foe stones unless it is totally stopped by Live dragons.

   * <p>Influence and deg of liberty point in Wulu.
   * Wulu defines the degree of liberty points as in the following figures.
   * Liberty point must be empty.
   * <pre>
   *      y2y
   *     yz1zy        mn
   *     21O12        OX
   *     yz1zy        mn
   *      y2y
   *      (a)         (b)
   * </pre>
   * In fig.a, O is a white stone and those points with other characters are empty.
   * The points 1 (adjacent) is the liberty point with degree 1 of the stone;
   * points 2 (jump) --degree 2;
   * points z (diagonal adjacent) --degree 1.5;
   * points y (knight) --degree 2.5.
   * In fig.b, O is a white stone, X is a black stone, and those points with m or n are empty.
   * m is a liberty point of the black stone with degree 2 (hane point),
   * and n is a liberty point of the white stone with degree 2.
   * The influence from stones of a color depends only on the nearest stone (with least degree):
   * <pre>
   *     degree              1     1.5    2    2.5
   *     white influence     6     5      3    2
   *     black influence    -6    -5     -3   -2
   * </pre>
   * Influence from both white and black can be compensated mutually.
   *  There is also a rounding scheme in Wulu like that in Handtalk with some differences.
   * As the calculation of influence is much simpler than that in Handtalk, the evaluation is much
   * faster.
   *
   * <p>Influence in Handtalk.
   * The influence of a normal white stone:
   * on its adjacent points is 4;
   * on its diagonal adjacent points is 3;
   * on its jump or knight points is 2;
   * on some points a little farer than jump or knight is 1.
   * A normal black stone radiates negative influence.
   * Dead stone radiates influence with opposite sign.
   * Half-dead or injured stone radiates less influence.
   * The influences of stones on a point are additive, but not linear additive.
   * For example, the influence on a point adjacent or diagonally adjacent to both black and white
   * stones is 0, independent on the numbers of black and white stones.
   * If the influence value of a point is 1 or -1, set it 0
   * (retaining 1|-1 to denote false eye-point of white|black).
   * If the influence value is greater than 2,
   * it is treated as a full white controlled point first and then rounded (see below);
   * if the influence value is less than -2,
   * it is treated as a full black controlled point first and then rounded.
   * A full white|black controlled point has its influence value of 6|-6.
   * The unit of resulting influence is referred to as dot.
   * The rounding scheme includes the following rules:
   * If adjacent to a point with 0 or negative influence, it never exceeds 3 dots;
   * If adjacent to a point with 1 or 2 dots, it never exceeds 5 dots.
   * There are similar rules for negative dots (black influence).
   * 1|-1 dot means false eye-point of white|black.
   *
   * <p>Influence in Jimmy.
   * The concept of influence has been used many times in computer Go.
   * The reason is that influence can simulate human playerâ€™s vision estimation of thickness.

  *     </ul>
  *   <li>Claimed by Handtalk:
  *       It has been found that when the number of moves to surround a block increases by 1,
  *       the danger will be halved. However, the number of foe moves to surround a block may be
  *       difficult to calculate.
  *   <li>LiveLevelInMoves = (number of enemy moves to reach the guaranteed dead state)
  *       - (number of buddy moves to reach the guaranteed live state) + 2
  *   <li>LiveLevelInSafety = 2 ^ LiveLevelInMoves
  *   <li>Explanations of LiveLevelInMoves:
  *     <ul>
  *       <li>+Infinity: AbsLive
  *           ("Infinity" is only meaningful in math; it doesn't make sense in practice.)
  *       <li>>4: enemy needs N (N>2) more moves to kill it ==> treated as AbsLive
  *       <li>4: enemy needs 2 more moves to kill it
  *       <li>3: enemy needs a Jie to kill it
  *       <li>2: enemy needs 1 more move to kill it; buddy needs 1 more move to live
  *       <li>1: buddy needs a Jie to live
  *       <li>0: buddy needs 2 more moves to live
  *       <li><0: buddy needs N (N>2) more moves to live ==> treated as AbsDead
  *       <li>-Infinity: AbsDead
  *     </ul>
  *   <li>Note: Radiated Influence = BaseInfluence * LiveLevel
  *       So we cannot have LiveLevel = +Infinity, otherwise, Influence will become infinitive.
